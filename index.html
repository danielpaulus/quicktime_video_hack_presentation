				<aside data-markdown class="notes">
					- I am Daniel, I was an AirForce Officer before joining Sauce and have a family with 4 kids here, I
					study philosophy on the side and love challenging things
					- I work on reverse engineering iOS and figuring out tricky problems with real devices.
					- I work with customer Apps, mobile features, testing frameworks, java, go, reverse engineering
					things
					- I was part of an internal project to run all real devices on linux server whereas before we had
					them
					on mac minis
					- so I pretty much know every detail about how iOS devices communicate with MAC OS
					- So let's start with a small history about today's project

					RDC live testing and automated
					- One of my first tasks when I got into RDC was to make live testing faster, it was low FPS
					- which is a servie we provide that lets customers remote control a real device
					- my manager said "its slow, see if you can make it faster"
					- i looked into options and among others found..

				<aside data-markdown class="notes">
					- at the time we thought it probably has DRM built in or some other encryption, so very hard
					- and I happened to stumple upon a cool internal private API that let me make live testing a lot
					faster without quicktime so we decided to move on
